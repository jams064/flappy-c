# Flappy C
Flappy bird in C with raylib

### About
This is my first experience with C itself (not c-like languages)

### Features
* Rendering
* "Physics" and collision
* Input
* User interface
* Headers split from source
* Saving to and loading from save file

### Requirements
* Raylib
* C compiler (Default is clang, change (CC) in Makefile to your preferred!)

## Building
* **All platforms**: make **build** (only tested on MacOS Sequoia, I assume it will on other platforms, it's just C)
* **Useful stuff**
  * make **clean**: removes all files from build
  * make **run**: builds the project, then runs it automatically
  * make **runc**: same as make run, but cleans after

If you need help, look online, I don't know either ðŸ˜¢
