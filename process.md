# My process

## Starting
I came into this project with little to no knowledge of Raylib, I had some knowledge of C from my experience with other C-like languages, but no idea how to use pointers, headers, and other stuff.  
  
I started by cloning the raylib quickstart template (https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart) and working from there in the main.c file it provided. This file can be found in at src/_oldmain.  

## Development
Fill out

## Refactoring
I got a working version of the game in this file, until I had the urge to split my files up. So I took on refactoring my code by taking the functions, structs, and macros into their related files. I then struggled with make files for a while until they worked.  
  
After the refactoring was complete, I added more features and polish, then I remembered version control. Which is why unfortunately I don't have any history of my work until late in the project.

## Extra
This project is still ongoing as of now. I will add more features and things in the future.

## Tools used
Pixen (https://pixenapp.com/mac/), for the art assets of the game. (MacOS only)  
VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com), for programming
